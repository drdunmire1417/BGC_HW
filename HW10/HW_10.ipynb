    "The \"iron hypothesis\" suggests that a lack of iron in the ocean prevents phytoplankton from achieving an algal bloom. The idea behind iron fertilization is that introducing iron in iron-poor regions will enhance phytoplankton productivity, decreasing surface ocean DIC and thus increasing the flux of anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere to the surface ocean.  It has been proposed as a geo-engineering solution to combat climate change. To test the iron hypothesis, you want to perform experiments by introducing iron where other nutrients necessary for photosynthesis are abundant but there is low iron availability. If other nutrients are limited, than the introduction of iron wont matter because photosynthesis will be limited anyways. One consequence of low iron availability is low chlorophyll concentrations. For these reasons, iron fertilization experiments have been conducted in high nutrient-low chlorophyll regions."

    "Dust is a source of $Fe^{2+}$, a more soluble form of iron that phytoplankton prefer for photosynthesis. A high concentrations of dust in the atmosphere means there is more soluble iron in the atmosphere which means there will be an increased flux of soluble iron from the atmosphere to the ocean. Phytoplankton need a small amount of iron to build proteins and enzymes which are used for photosynthesis, nitrate utilization, and nitrogen fixation. If there is an iron increase in iron-poor oceanic regions then chlorophyll and net primary production will increase, leading to a decrease in surface ocean DIC.  If the surface ocean DIC decreases, then the surface ocean can uptake more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  In this way, an increase in atmospheric dust could have led to a decrease in atmospheric $CO_2$ during the last glacial maximum."

Another fix is to put more trees in the ground or to better the places where we make food. A third fix is put stuff into the big blue water thing so that it can take the things out of the sky that warm where we live. Most of these fixes would not help and many of them have problems with them.  Like, if we put stuff into the big blue water thing then how will the animals respond?
